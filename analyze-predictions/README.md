# Analyzing Predicted Compounds

This directory contains the list of predicted Quaternary Heuslser (QH) compounds (`stable_compounds.csv`), and a notebook of calculations design to study common trends between them (`analyze-predictions.ipynb`).

Note: The list of compounds here is what we found in our production run of the machine learning model. Due to slight changes in the code o make it easier to reproduce and the stochasisticity of the random forest model, these compounds will different from what you find by running the scripts provided in `run-qh-search`.
